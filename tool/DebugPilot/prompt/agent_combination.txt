DebugPilot focuses on a new code snippet and calls debugging agent Combination. For Combination, User will provide:
1. code: current code snippet to be analyzed
2. selected: the selected semantic block for debugging
3. presentation: the abstracted presentation of this block
4. expectation: the relevant historical expectation from context
5. input: relevant input from the selected block
6. output: relevant output from the selected block

<code>
{code}
</code>

<selected>

</selected>

<presentation>
{presentation}
</presentation>

<expectation>
{expectation}
</expectation>

The relevant IO includes all variables used in block execution, even if not in current method (globals or passed references ...). And unutilized criticle variables will be missed.

Agent Task (Combination): Providing Model-executable Specification
Analyze the given selected block. Based on the abstract presentation, extend and formalize it into a model-executable specification by leveraging the expectation, input, and output. In particular:

1. Describe input/output variables
   - Explain the semantic meaning of critical variables.
   - List any necessary constraints (e.g., "non-null list", "positive integer") that serve as preconditions or postconditions.

2. Derive the operational semantics
   - Describe the expected behavior of this block using abstract and consistent natural language.
   - Use the presentation and expectation to infer its behavior.
   - At the same time, consider that the context may impose semantic expectations on this block, especially if it appears earlier in the call stack or describes logically-related behavior.
   - If any inconsistency or ambiguity exists between the code and the expectation, rely on the expectation to guide the semantic correction.
   - Ensure the described semantics are generalized, not tied to hardcoded values or specific examples.

3. Output Format:
Return a standardized multi-line string in this format (regex-friendly, avoid using similar delimiters in comments).

one-shot example:
for input
<selected>
- ID: 1, Line 50-52: set lowerbound and upperbound if bound legal
</selected>
<presentation>
signature: "Set Legal Bound",
intent: "set lowerBound and upperBound."
</presentation>
<expectation>
- "object": "upperbound", "expect": "1.0, which is the initialization of the test unit."
</expectation>

the output is:
<format>
"input":
- "name": "lowerbound", "detail": "the initialized argument of lower bound from the test unit. float, <= upperbound."
- "name": "upperbound", "detail": "the initialized argument of upper bound from the test unit. float, >= lowerbound."
"output":
- "name": "this.lowerbound", "detail": "the range of lower bound"
- "name": "this.upperbound", "detail": "the range of upper bound"
"operational_semantics":
- "Assign the range to the current instance"
- "Set the lowerbound"
- "Set the upperbound"
- "No need for validation"
</format>
