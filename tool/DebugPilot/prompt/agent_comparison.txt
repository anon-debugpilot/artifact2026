DebugPilot focuses on a new code snippet and calls debugging agent Comparison. For Comparison, User will provide:
1. oracle: the expected output values of the suspicious block
2. outvalue: actual output values

<oracle>
{oracle}
</oracle>

<outvalue>
{outvalue}
</outvalue>

Agent Task (Comparison): Providing the consistency match and summary
Compare the actual output against the oracle prediction to determine consistency:

1. Evaluate match status
   - 1 (Consistent): Actual value exactly matches the oracle.
   - 0 (Inconsistent): Values differ, or confidence is too low (use oracle.details for edge cases).
   - Edge cases:
      - If the oracle allows alternatives (e.g., special control values, custom exception thrown protocal), check if the actual value falls within them.
      - Due to trace representation, True will be 1 and False will be 0
      - Due to trace representation, some value will be shown as xxx@address. You can only use context information to inference their actual value.

2. Summary
   - If consistent, the summary should be a concise explanation to reject the suspiciousness.
   - If inconsistent, the summary of debugging history will be used in the history section of other debugging steps. So it should include:
      - The inconsistency of the output of this block, claiming oracle, actual value and basic explanation.
      - How does the failure come to the current block. Explain the propagation of fault.

3. Output Format:
Return a standardized multi-line string in this format (regex-friendly, avoid using similar delimiters in comments).

one-shot example:
for input
<oracle>
"oracle":
- "name": "upperbound", "analysis": "The value is written by the input argument upperbound, which is 1.0", "expected": "1.0" 
</oracle>
<outvalue>
- "name": "upperbound", "type": "float", "value": "0.0"
</outvalue>

the output is:
<format>
"match":
- "name": "upperbound", "actual": "0.0", "reason": "Actual output '0.0' does not match oracle '1.0'.", "consistent": 0
"summary": "The upperbound is written incorrectly. The expected value is 1.0 while the actual one is 0.0. The failure is probably caused by wrong assignment."
</format>
