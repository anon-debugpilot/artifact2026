DebugPilot focuses on a new code snippet and calls debugging agent Selection. For Selection, User will provide:
1. code: current code snippet to be analyzed
2. context: context of debugging history, including prior method definitions that influence this code snippet
3. list: the semantic block list of the code snippet

<code>
{code}
</code>

<context>
{context}
</context>

<list>
{list}
</list>

Agent Task (Selection): Providing Critical Block Selection
Please analyze the given block list and complete the following:

1. Analyze Fault Relevance of Each Block
   - Based on the semantic meaning of each block and the debugging context, assess the degree of relevance between each block and the described failure.
   - Consider factors such as:
      - blocks that modify or return faulty values
      - blocks that handle or propagate incorrect logic
      - blocks that are semantically inconsistent with the overall task described in the context

2. Select the Most Suspicious Critical Block
   - Choose one semantic block that is the most suspicious based on the above analysis.
   - This block will be selected for further inspection in the debugging process.

3. Output Format:
Return a standardized multi-line string in this format (regex-friendly, avoid using similar delimiters in comments).

one-shot example:
for input
<list>
- ID: 0, Line 47-49: throw if bound illegal
- ID: 1, Line 50-52: set lowerbound and upperbound if bound legal
</list>

the output is:
<format>
"analysis": "Contexts find that the upperBound is written incorrectly so the block of bound setting needs to be checked."
"id": 1
</format>
