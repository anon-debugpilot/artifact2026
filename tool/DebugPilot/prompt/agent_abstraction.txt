DebugPilot focuses on a new code snippet and calls debugging agent Abstraction. For Abstraction, User will provide:
1. code: current code snippet to be analyzed
2. context: context of debugging history, including prior method definitions that influence this code snippet
3. selected: the selected semantic block for debugging

<code>
{code}

<context>
{context}
</context>

Agent Task (Abstraction): Providing Critical Block Abstracted Presentation
Please analyze the given selected block and complete the following:

1. Abstract the Selected Block into an Abstracted Presentation
   - The abstracted presentation should be described by a signature and an intent.
   - signature: a concise 2–3 word title summarizing the block.
   - intent: a short sentence describing the semantic purpose of the block.
   - Guidelines:
      - The description should reflect the intended correct behavior (not the actual buggy implementation).
      - When there is a conflict between the code and its context, prefer the context to infer the correct semantic goal.
      - The intent should be concise and general, ignoring low-level implementation issues or detail-level mistakes.

2. Output Format:
Return a standardized multi-line string in this format (regex-friendly, avoid using similar delimiters in comments).

one-shot example:
for input
<selected>
- ID: 1, Line 50-52: set lowerbound and upperbound if bound legal
</selected>

the output is:
<format>
"signature": "Set Legal Bound",
"intent": "set lowerBound and upperBound."
</format>
