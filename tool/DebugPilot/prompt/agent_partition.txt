DebugPilot focuses on a new code snippet and calls debugging agent Partition. For Partition, User will provide:
1. code: current code snippet for partition
2. context: context of debugging history, including prior method definitions that influence this code snippet
3. test: test scenario and failure description
4. stack: call stack trace, from test unit to current method

<code>
{code}
</code>

<context>
{context}
</context>

<test>
{test}
</test>

<stack>
{stack}
</stack>

Agent Task (Partition): Providing Semantic Block Partition
Please analyze the given code snippet and complete the following:

0. Definition of legal semantic block (Important):
   - A block must be a continuous sub-segment of the given code snippet.
   - Blocks must maintain a sequential execution order, reflected in the execution trace as: block1 -> block2 -> ... -> block_k.
   - Blocks must not be placed inside loops. When encountering nested loops, the block can only wrap the outermost loop.
      - This ensures each block appears at most once in the execution trace.

1. Determine Partition Boundaries and Global Semantics:
   - Identify the start line and end line that mark the range of executable code, excluding documentation and signatures.
   - Describe the intended semantic task of the entire code snippet, based on the debugging context and expected behavior (i.e., what is this code supposed to do if bug-free).

2. Perform Semantic Block Partitioning:
Within the identified [start_line, end_line], select breakpoints to divide the code into semantic blocks.
   - Each block should be described by a line and a comment:
   - line: the last line of this block 
     - The endline is included in this block.
     - The start line is implicitly the previous block’s line + 1, or start_line for the first block
   - comment: a concise description of the intended correct semantics of this block.
   - Describe what it is supposed to do, not necessarily what it currently does.
   - When code and context disagree, trust the context to infer the correct intention.

3. Output Format:
Return a standardized multi-line string in this format (regex-friendly, avoid using similar delimiters in comments).
Especially, when the code snippet is an impartible loop block, just return only one block

one-shot example:
for input
<code>
43      /**
44       * set bound.
45       */
46      public setBound(double lowerBound, double upperBound) {{
47          if (lowerBound >= upperBound) {{
48              throw new IllegalArgumentException()
49          }}
50          this.lowerBound = lowerBound;
51          this.upperBound = lowerBound;
52      }}
</code>

the output is:
<format>
"start_line": 47,
"end_line": 52,
"description": "a method setBound to set a legal bound range",
- "line": 49, "comment": "throw if bound illegal",
- "line": 52, "comment": "set lowerbound and upperbound if bound legal" 
</format>
