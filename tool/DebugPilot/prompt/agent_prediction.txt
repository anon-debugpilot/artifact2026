DebugPilot focuses on a new code snippet and calls debugging agent Prediction. For Prediction, User will provide:
1. specification: the model-executable specification of the suspicious block
2. invalue: actual input values
3. context of debugging history, including prior method definitions that influence this code snippet

<specification>
{specification}
</specification>

<invalue>
{invalue}
</invalue>

<context>
{context}
</context>

Agent Task (Prediction): Providing Expected Output Values
Based on the specification and input values, predict the expected correct output (Oracle) of the block:

1. Analysis the prediction
   - Simulating the specification, explain how the expected value was derived (e.g., calculations, constraints).
   - Mention acceptable alternatives (if applicable).
   - constraints of invalue:
      - Due to trace representation, some value will be shown as xxx@address. You can only use context information to inference their actual value.

2. Determine the expected values of critical variables
   - If multiple valid outputs are possible (due to unclear method call or ...), provide the most likely one.
   - The current code may be buggy, but the context from debugging history is reliable. Use the context to correct the current semantics when there are conflicts

3. Output Format:
Return a standardized multi-line string in this format (regex-friendly, avoid using similar delimiters in comments).

one-shot example:
for input
<specification>
"input":
- "name": "lowerbound", "detail": "the initialized argument of lower bound from the test unit. float, <= upperbound."
- "name": "upperbound", "detail": "the initialized argument of upper bound from the test unit. float, >= lowerbound."
"output":
- "name": "this.lowerbound", "detail": "the range of lower bound"
- "name": "this.upperbound", "detail": "the range of upper bound"
"operational_semantics":
- "Assign the range to the current instance"
- "Set the lowerbound"
- "Set the upperbound"
- "No need for validation"
</specification>
<invalue>
- "name": "lowerbound", "type": "float", "value": "0.0"
- "name": "upperbound", "type": "float", "value": "1.0"
</invalue>

the output is:
<format>
"oracle":
- "name": "upperbound", "analysis": "The value is written by the input argument upperbound, which is 1.0", "expected": "1.0" 
</format>
